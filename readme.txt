Add Pre-Footer Widgets to the GeneratePress theme

== Description ==

Add a Pre-Footer Widgets area  to the GeneratePress theme that is similar to the GeneratePress Footer Widgets area but appears immediately before the Footer Widgets on the page. It works just like the GeneratePress footer widgets and can be styled the same way as the GeneratePress footer widgets in the WordPress Theme Customizer. In addition, if you have GeneratePress Premium installed, the WP247 GeneratePress Pre-Footer Widgets plugin will provide additional Customization options for the Pre-Footer section.

== Installation ==

In the WordPress backend:

- Go to Plugins->Add New
- Search for the plugin 'wp247 GeneratePress Pre-Footer Widgets'
- Click the "Install" button
- Click on "Activate"

That's it. You're now ready to customize your pre-footer widgets through the WordPress Theme Customizer.
